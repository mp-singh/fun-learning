This repo contains all the differnt data structures and algorithms that I'm brushing up on.

## Installation

You can clone this repo and run all the tests to make sure the pass. :)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mp-singh/fun-learning.git
go test ./...
```

I will try to write some benchmarks as I go.(HA!) You can run them all with:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Suggestions/Improvements
I thrive to always be a better version of myself so if you see something that can be improved anywhere in the code, please let me know.
Suggestions of new algorithms or datastructures I should add to this repo are also welcome. Please open an issue to discuss or reach out to me directly via email.
